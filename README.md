## Description
This application will build a list of burgers based on user input. When users enter a burger name within the textbox and click the "Submit" button, their created burger title will be added to the lefthand side of the screen with a "Devour" button next to it--just in case they get a bit peckish! When this "Devour" button is clicked, the burger will be moved to the righthand side of the UI showing it has been thoroughly ingested by the ravenous users.

The users need not fear, however! They will be able to add as many burgers any they desire to satiate their hunger.

This application uses MySQL to store data, as well as Handlebars to dynamically create the UI for each next to-be-devoured and devoured burger on the docket.
